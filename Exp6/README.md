# Aim: 
- Classic architectures of Convolutional Neural Network

# Objectives:
- Implement the classic architectures - AlexNet, LeNet5, VGG16, VGG19
- Apply these architectures of CIFAR10, CIFAR100, MNIST, FashionMNIST, ImageNet Cat vs Dog
- Analyze performance of these architectures- accuracy, error
- Deploy best architecture as Flask app - choose best model on anyone one dataset
- Read the papers in reference and mention lessons learnt from the papers
