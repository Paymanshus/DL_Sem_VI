# Aim: 
- Classic architectures of Convolutional Neural Network

# Objectives:
- Use keras pretrained models in the list of available models given in below table
- Download an imagenet dataset of two classes of your choice
- Find out which pretrained model is most suitable for classification
- Compare models performance on basis of precision, recall, accuracy, f1 score
- Deploy best model on flask app
- Calculate time taken to generate inference from flask app
